= Executable

* http://rubyworks.github.com/executable
* http://github.com/rubyworks/executable


== DESCRIPTION

The Executable mixin is a very quick and and easy
way to make almost any class usable via a command
line interface. It simply uses writer methods as
option setters, and the first command line argument
as the method to call, with the subsequent arguments
passed to the method.


== FEATURES

* Super easy to use, just mixin.
* Public writters become CLI options.
* Public methods become subcommands.


== RELEASE NOTES

Please see HISTORY file.


== SYNOPSIS

Simply mixin Executable, then call #execute_command.

  class X
    include Executable

    attr_accessor :quiet

    def bread(*args)
      ["BREAD", quiet, *args]
    end

    def butter(*args)
      ["BUTTER", quiet, *args]
    end
  end

  x = X.new

  x.execute_command("butter yum")
  => ["BUTTER", nil, "yum"]

  x.execute_command("bread --quiet")
  => ["BREAD", true]

See RDocs for more information.
