== DESCRIPTION

Think of Executable as a *COM*, a Command-line Object Mapper,
in much the same way that ActiveRecord is an ORM,
an Object Relational Mapper. A class utilizing Executable
can define a complete command line tool using nothing more
than Ruby's own own standard syntax. No special DSL is required. 


== FEATURES

* Easy to use, just mixin or subclass.
* Define #call to control the command procedure.
* Public writers become options.
* Namespace children become subcommands.
* Or easily dispatch subcommands to public methods.
* Generate help in plain text or markdown.


== LIMITATIONS

* Ruby 1.9+ only.
* Help doesn't handle aliases well (yet).


== RELEASE NOTES

Please see HISTORY.rdoc file.


== SYNOPSIS

Executable can be use as a mixin, or as a subclass via `Executable::Base`.
Add methods to you class to handle command-line options. Writer methods 
(those ending in '=') correspond to an options and a query method (those
ending in '?') mark an attribute as a flag option. 

For example, here is a simple "Hello, World!" commandline tool.

    require 'executable'

    class HelloCommand < Executable::Command
      # Say it in uppercase?
      def load=(bool)
        @loud = bool
      end

      #
      def loud?
        @loud
      end

      # Show this message.
      def help?
        cli.show_help
        exit
      end
      alias :h? :help?

      # Say hello.
      def call(name)
        name = name || 'World'
        str  = "Hello, #{name}!"
        str  = str.upcase if loud?
        puts str
      end
    end

To make the command available on the command line, add an executable
to your project passing ARGV to the #execute or #run methods.

    #!usr/bin/env ruby
    require 'hello.rb'
    HelloCommand.run

If we named this file `hello`, set its execute flag and made it available
on our systems $PATH, then:

    $ hello
    Hello, World!

    $ hello John
    Hello, John!

    $ hello --loud John
    HELLO, JOHN!

Executable can also generate help text for commands.

    $ hello --help
    USAGE: hello [options]

    Say hello.

    --loud      Say it in uppercase?
    --help      Show this message

If you look back at the class definition you can see it's pulling
comments from the source to provide descriptions. It pulls the 
description the command itself from the `#call` method.

Basic help like this is fine for personal tools, but for public facing
production applications it is desirable to utilize manpages. To this end,
Executable provides Markdown formatted help as well. We can access this,
for example, via `HelloCommand.help.markdown`. The idea with this is that
we can save the output to `man/hello.ronn` or copy it the top of our `bin/`
file, edit it to perfection and then use tools such a {ronn}[https://github.com/rtomayko/ronn],
{binman}[https://github.com/sunaku/binman] or {md2man}[https://github.com/sunaku/md2man]
to generate the manpages. What's particularly cool about Executable,
is that once we have a manpage in the standard `man/` location in our project,
the `#show_help` method will use it instead of the plain text.

and {API}[http://rubydoc.info/gems/executable/frames] documentation.
