summary: Commandline Object Mapper
version: 1.2.0
name: executable
title: Executable
description: ! 'Think of Executable as a *COM*, a Commandline Object Mapper,

  in much the same way that ActiveRecord is an ORM,

  an Object Relational Mapper. A class utilizing Executable

  can define a complete command line tool using nothing more

  than Ruby''s own method definitions.'
