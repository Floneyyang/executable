= Cliable

* http://death.rubyforge.org
* http://death.rubyforge.org/cliable

== DESCRIPTION:

The Cliable mixin is a very quick and and easy
way to make almost any class usable via a command
line interface. It simply uses writer methods as
option setters, and the first command line argument
as the method to call, with the subsequent arguments
passed to the method.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Super easy to use --just mixin.
* Uses public writters as CLI options.
* And public methods as subcommands.

== RELEASE/NOTES:

Please see RELEASE file.

== SYNOPSIS:

Simply mixin Cliable, then call #execute_command.

  class X
    include Cliable
    attr_accessor :quiet
    def bread(*args)
      ["BREAD", quiet, *args]
    end
    def butter(*args)
      ["BUTTER", quiet, *args]
    end
  end

  x = X.new

  x.execute_command("butter yum")
  => ["BUTTER", nil, "yum"]

  x.execute_command("bread --quiet")
  => ["BUTTER", true]

See RDocs for more information.
