<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<p>The Executable mixin is a very quick and and easy way to make almost any
class usable via a command line interface. It simply uses writer methods as
option setters, and the first command line argument as the method to call,
with the subsequent arguments passed to the method.</p>

<h2>FEATURES</h2>
<ul><li>
<p>Super easy to use, just mixin.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Public writters become CLI options.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Public methods become subcommands.</p>
</li></ul>

<h2>RELEASE NOTES</h2>

<p>Please see HISTORY file.</p>
